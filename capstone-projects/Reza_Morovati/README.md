## Project Summary

This project initially aimed to assess soil moisture variability and hydrologic response in the Logan River watershed using the Advanced Terrestrial Simulator (ATS). However, due to limitations in available soil moisture data, particularly the sparse and plain-area-focused SCAN network data from NRCS, primarily located within the Great Salt Lake Basin — the study area and focus were adjusted. The project now centers on the Red Butte Creek watershed, where the objective is to compare evapotranspiration (ET) estimates from ATS simulations with remote sensing-based ET data from OpenET. By using physics-based simulations with ATS, which model variably saturated flow and surface–subsurface interactions with meteorological forcing, soil properties, and land cover information, the study aims to evaluate how well the simulated ET matches observations. The expected outcomes include improved understanding of the performance of ATS in replicating real-world ET dynamics and insights into the applicability of advanced modeling for watershed management and drought forecasting.
